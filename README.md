# Personal Therapy MindMap x Chatbot

Welcome to the MindMap Chatbot! This project combines the power of conversational AI and mental visualization. The chatbot functions as a virtual therapist, engaging in conversations and providing emotional support. The data from these conversations is then processed and visualized into a dynamic mind map, offering users insights into their thought patterns and mental state.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The MindMap Chatbot consists of two main components:

Chatbot (Therapist): An empathetic, conversational AI that engages with users to help them process thoughts, feelings, and emotions. It provides a safe space to talk about daily life, stress, and mental well-being.

Mind Map Generator: After the conversation, the data is processed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The resulting insights are visualized as a mind map, providing a structured representation of the user's mental landscape.
